The computer is a wonderful gift of science. It was discovered by the British scientist Charles Babbage. The U.S. scientist Howard Aiken improved it to its present digital status. Computer is a great labour-saving device. It is like a super electronic brain doing all sorts of difficult and strenuous jobs with speed and accuracy.

The age old system of keeping records in voluminous registers and files is gradually making way for computer based data processing. Records and data stored inside a computer can be retrieved in a second by the click of a button. Thus, it can accomplish otherwise time consuming tasks instantly. It is now extensively used in banks, offices, shops, laboratories, and hospitals. Computers are also used in railways and airline offices for booking and reservation of tickets.

Computer based telecommunication networks set up links instantly with any part of the world in a second. In the fields of medical diagnosis and printing technology, it is doing wonders. Space flights would not have been possible without the application of computer science.

Computers help the school children learn new techniques of study, graphic designs, games and other useful educational applications. They help the college students in doing projects and preparing reports. It is, therefore, essential that students learn the basics of computer operation followed by advanced level training. This will open up good careers for them in future.
